This is where I will scope out the general plan for a game of blackjack.

Development Plan
1. Start the game
- create a Game class that starts the game by asking the user for x amount of players, and dealing 
    x amount of blackjack hands
- create a Player class (will have x players)
- use promptly module to get above information from user via terminal
- create appropriate redux actions and reducers to hold players' hands
2. Play the game
