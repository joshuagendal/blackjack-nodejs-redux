# blackjack-nodejs-redux
Blackjack game made w/ nodejs as server and redux as state manager. No UI, game is run through npm CLI package promptly.



I am writing this blackjack app for two reasons:

1. To solidify my foundation of software development principles, mainly of seperation of concerns. When writing front-end or back-end apps with
reactjs or nodejs, so much focus is inherently devoted to learning the proper frameworks/associated tools to accomplish application specifics.
One must deeply grasp software development principles and, hopefully, use the seemingly endless node modules in a way that extends
these proper principles. This project will be a way for me to explore using simple tools to build an application that is built with
proper principles in mind. Mainly seperation of concerns, and how this seperation of concerns inherently leads to code that is easier to test
and easier for others to understand.

2. To explore the javascript programming language without worrying about responses from remote data sources.
